# Arrow integration testing

Our strategy for integration testing between Arrow implementations is as follows:

* Test datasets are specified in a custom human-readable, JSON-based format
  designed for Arrow

* Each implementation provides a testing executable capable of converting
  between the JSON and the binary Arrow file representation

* The test executable is also capable of validating the contents of a binary
  file against a corresponding JSON file

## Environment setup

The integration test data generator and runner is written in Python and
currently requires Python 3.6 or higher. You can create a standalone Python
distribution and environment for running the tests by using [miniconda][1]. On
Linux this is:

```shell
MINICONDA_URL=https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
wget -O miniconda.sh $MINICONDA_URL
bash miniconda.sh -b -p miniconda
export PATH=`pwd`/miniconda/bin:$PATH

conda create -n arrow-integration python=3.6 nomkl numpy six
conda activate arrow-integration
```

If you are on macOS, instead use the URL:

```shell
MINICONDA_URL=https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

After this, you can follow the instructions in the next section.

## Running the existing integration tests

The integration tests are run using the `archery integration` command.

```
archery integration --help
```

Depending on which components you have built, you can enable and add them to
the test run. For example, if you only have the C++ project built, you set:

```
export ARROW_CPP_EXE_PATH=$CPP_BUILD_DIR/debug
archery integration --with-cpp=1
```

For Java, it may look like:

```
VERSION=0.11.0-SNAPSHOT
export ARROW_JAVA_INTEGRATION_JAR=$JAVA_DIR/tools/target/arrow-tools-$VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar
archery integration --with-cpp=1 --with-java=1
```
